## Introduction

This project explores the application of various recurrent neural network architectures for time series forecasting using the New York Taxi dataset. The focus is on comparing the performance of RNN, LSTM, and GRU models.

## Dataset

The New York Taxi dataset includes trip records from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). It is a popular dataset for time series analysis and forecasting.

## Models

The following models are implemented and compared in this notebook:
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results
The notebook provides detailed analysis and visualization of the performance of each model on the New York Taxi dataset. The results include loss curves, predictions, and performance metrics.
